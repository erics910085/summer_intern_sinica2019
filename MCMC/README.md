We are dealing with the problem by using MCMC to solve encryption.\\

Notice that it decode most of every alphbat, but still with some error. In this case, it always has bad performance on decoding s and t.
I think the reason of that is s and t is often being used in a word, thus, they are not like the alphbat 'Q' that has most probabilities connecting some word.\\
almost every char is possible to connect s also be possible to connect t.So the encryption in this case is no different substituting each other.
